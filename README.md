# CarMach-Solution
Create a car service site using Django as the back-end and React for the front-end. Set up Django to handle user authentication, manage service records, and book appointments, while React provides a dynamic user interface. Use Django REST Framework to create APIs that React will consume for seamless data flow and interaction.
